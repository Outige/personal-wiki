**Q**: How to split time between getting my task done and doing meta learning to take away more expertise to help me in the future?  
**Q**: Can you give me a reading list of books or courses or articles that you would recommend for me on `topic-x` or very generally?

**Q**: How to split time between getting my task done and doing meta learning to take away more expertise to help me in the future.  

- Deadline is always first.
- With time remaining work through and make sense of your solution.
- Get many reviewers and difficult reviewers. That way you'll get the most feedback.
    - Learnings will likely be domain specific ie server specific - they know where the bodies lie. But the more beginner you are the more general the feedback will also be like use a stream here etc.
- Learning can be very cyclical and rabbit holey. So be careful not to get sucked in while you have a task.
