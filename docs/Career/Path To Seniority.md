# Path To Seniority
This page is more a less an improvement plan. How I plan to improve on my skills as a software engineer and achieve status as a senior engineer.

# Using my free time to learn
Basically I've identified that there is a huge amount that I don't know and that this is holding me back from progressing at a steady or fast pace.

There are three-ish very broad categories of information in which I am lacking

1. General technology specific knowledge
2. Project / domain specific knowledge
3. High level pattern knowledge

## General technology specific knowledge
This type of knowledge is basically fairly consistent across most projects and teams and orgs and companies etc that are using similar technologies. This is probably the wrong area to hyper fixate and is likely what a jnr engineer ends up fixating on.
### Java
1. Collections: Streams etc
2. Just get better at java
3. Spring boot
4. Threads
### DB
1. Joins on the fly
2. Indexes

## Project / domain specific knowledge
This kind of knowledge is basically how and what and why are services doing what they are doing. How are they inter wound. The deployment life cycle etc.

## High level pattern knowledge
Basically clean code first. Then clean architecture.

# Write everything down
